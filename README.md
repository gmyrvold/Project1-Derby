# Project1-Derby

-Welcome to the Derby!-

This game is designed to help you learn math... specifically multiplication!

I designed this game to be similar to flash cards that would be used in school, but in a way that's entertaining and motivates you to keep going until you win!

How to play this game is simple:

1. Follow your horse as it moves on the line called "player 1", that's you!

2. Press the "Start Game" button to begin, this will trigger the other horses to race with you as you answer math questions
3. Follow each question prompt and type your answer in the text box and then hit submit. If it's the right answer, you'll advance further in the race!
4. To the left of the questions the game will display which place you're in compared to your competitors, if you reach the finish line in first place, you win!
